I graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas with a B.S. in biochemistry and currently work in the Palmer lab where I specialize in membrane biology and bacterial genetics. Through my projects, I have garnered an interest in data science and work to further my analytical skills.\n\n\n\n#Here is evidence of me using R\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nInformation you may or may not need about me is that I am a competitive League of Legends player, peaking Masters in season 13 split 1. I am by all accounts a mechanical keyboard enthusiast who has invested probably too much time and money into that hobby. And I am always looking to expand my LegoÂ® collection."
